### groupId
The groupId is like a package name in Java. It usually follows a reverse domain name structure (e.g., com.example.project or org.company.app).
It identifies the organization or group that is responsible for the project.
Example:
- com.example.myapp
- org.apache.maven.plugins

### artifactId
The artifactId is the name of the project (or the library) and should be unique within the groupId.
